**** Still drafting this is placeholder text****

Note that in respect to this project, all datasets and problems are not created equal--while you could likely build a working model for just about any dataset you find in theory, in practice, you'll find that many datasets have dimensionality issues that make them intractable for training without spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars training your model on a professional server cluster filled with high-end GPUs.

A good litmus test for checking a project's feasibility is to head over to Kaggle or do a quick Google search to see if anyone else has already solved this problem. If they have, then it's likely that you can, too! Just remember, you only have access to a local machine for this project, not a server cluster, so the problem should be one that can be solved on your own laptop!

Here are some caveats you should consider when selecting your dataset:
